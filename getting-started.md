## Installation

### Text Editor
If you don’t have one yet, install a text editor. [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are good choices. You can use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as used in _inleiding programmeren_ but we don't recommend it. 

> Be ware that lecturers may not be able to help you with problems in some specific editors.

### GitHub

If you haven’t already, [sign up for
GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).

Take some time to set up your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).
Include your name, a profile picture, and a URL to your homepage.
You’re allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive
information, but a good looking GitHub profile can help you get an internship
or job later.

You will hand in your assignments on GitHub. You can [drag and drop your files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) via the website but you can also use the [GitHub desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). We don't really cover using Git and GitHub in this course, feel free to ask other students and your teacher to help get you up and running.

## Communication

This minor doesn't provide a slack channel for students and teachers to communicate, feel free to setup a Whatsapp group of some sorts with all students in your class. I (Danny) have a _no e-mail policy_, if you have any questions please contact me directly on Whatsapp or Telegram (+316 28 49 35 96).

> If you have technical questions feel free to ask them but keep the following in mind:
> * First ask questions to other students, they might have encountered the same problem and found a solution. 
> * Don't use screenshots but link to specific files or snippets in your GitHub repo.
> * Accurately describe your problem and let teachers know which solutions you've  already tried.

## Introduction
Introduce yourself to your teacher! Open an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][issues]. You can pick what are called `issue templates`. Each assignment has a different template in which you can hand in your assignments for that week. This is also the place where teachers and Student-Asistants will give you feedback.

> Fill in the **introduction** issue template with the _correct information_. Your teacher will have all the info needed to add your grade to the admin sheet.

#### Description
Your artwork should respond to input from the user. Use transitions, animation, pseudo-classes and events to make your artwork interactive.
* Can the user `:hover` over certain elements with their mouse?
* What happens when the user tries to use a keyboard?
* Can the user click on elements?
* Do you need JavaScript to listen for events?
